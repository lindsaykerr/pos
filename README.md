# Simple POS - Rust attempt (Archieved)

These files show an attempt to utilise Rust and Tauri to create a simple POS system. While this would ultimately end up as a failed project, barely leaving the starting block, I still consider it a good experience. Through it, I discovered my absolute destain for the Rust programming language, the frustration of trying to implement functionality that would extremely easy in most other programming languages cemented my view that Rust was not for me and it was no replacement for C++. Those who love it can have it.
